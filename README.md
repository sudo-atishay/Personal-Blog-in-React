Personal Website

This repository contains a minimal, single-page portfolio site (plain HTML/CSS) placed in `public/` for easy static hosting or local preview.

Quick preview (recommended):

- Using Python 3 built-in server from the `public/` folder:

	1. cd public
	2. python3 -m http.server 8000
	3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

Notes:
- The page uses `public/Atishay Jain Photo.jpg` for the profile image.
- Styles are in `public/styles.css`. The React app is left intact in `src/` if you prefer to keep a React-based workflow.
